# Installing

## Building from source

First you need to get the source code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roqueando/oluwoye.git
cd oluwoye
```

Then you build the application. Make sure that you have [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed.

```sh
go build cmd/olu/olu.go
```

And there you "go", this will generate a binary called `olu` and you can run this using
```sh
./olu
```

## Installing using homebrew

Coming soon
